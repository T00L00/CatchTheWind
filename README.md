# CatchTheWind
Beginner project worked on by small team of pixel artists and programmers learning Unity. Abandoned.

2D platformer game about an AI-controlled sapling that rides the wind to reach its destinations.
The player swipes to generate wind currents that carry the sapling where it needs to go.
Background wind current system was built using a 2D Vector Force Field that could be tweaked by adjusting variables
in a generalized equation.
